            <h3>Chelsea</h3>

            <article>
                <p>
                    Chelsea Football Club is an English professional football club based in Fulham, West London. Founded
                    in 1905, the team play
                    their home games at Stamford Bridge.[5] The club competes in the Premier League, the top division of
                    English football.
                    It won its first major honour, the League championship, in 1955. The club won the FA Cup for the
                    first time in 1970,
                    their first European honour, the Cup Winners' Cup, in 1971, and became the third English club to win
                    the Club World Cup in 2022.
                    Chelsea is one of five clubs to have won all three pre-1999 main European club competitions, and the
                    only club to have
                    won all three major European competitions twice. They are also the only London club to have won the
                    Champions League
                    and the Club World Cup.[6] Domestically, the club has won six league titles, eight FA Cups, five
                    League Cups, and four
                    FA Community Shields. Internationally, they have won the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Europa
                    League, the UEFA Cup Winners'
                    Cup and the UEFA Super Cup twice each, and the FIFA Club World Cup once since their inception. In
                    terms of overall trophies won,
                    Chelsea is the fourth-most successful club in English football.
                    The club has rivalries with neighbouring teams Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur,
                    and a historic rivalry with Leeds United. In terms of club value,
                    Chelsea is the eighth-most-valuable football club in the world
                    (as of 2022), worth $3.10 billion, and is the eighth-highest-earning football club in the
                    world.[7][8]

            <h3>History</h3>

            <article>
                <p>
                In 1904, Gus Mears acquired the Stamford Bridge athletics stadium in Fulham with the aim of turning
                it into a football ground.
                An offer to lease it to nearby Fulham F.C. was turned down, so Mears opted to found his own club to
                use the stadium. As there was
                already a team named Fulham in the borough, the name of the adjacent borough of Chelsea was chosen
                for the new club; names like
                Kensington FC, Stamford Bridge FC and London FC were also considered.[9] Chelsea F.C. was founded on
                10 March 1905 at The Rising
                Sun pub (now The Butcher's Hook),[1][10] opposite the present-day main entrance to the ground on
                Fulham Road, and were elected to the Football League shortly afterwards.
                Chelsea won promotion to the First Division in their second season, and yo-yoed between the First
                and Second Divisions in its early years.
                The team reached the 1915 FA Cup final, where they lost to Sheffield United at Old Trafford, and
                finished third in the First Division in
                1920, the club's best league campaign to that point.[11] Chelsea had a reputation for signing star
                players[12] and attracted large crowds.
                The club had the highest average attendance in English football in ten separate seasons[13]
                including 1907–08,[14] 1909–10,[15] 1911–12,[16]
                1912–13,[17] 1913–14[18] and 1919–20.[19][20] They were FA Cup semi-finalists in 1920 and 1932 and
                remained in the First Division throughout
                the 1930s,but success eluded the club in the inter-war years

            <h3>Modernisation and the first league championship</h3>

            <p>
                Former Arsenal and England centre-forward Ted Drake was appointed manager in 1952 and proceeded to
                modernise the club. He removed
                the club's Chelsea pensioner crest, improved the youth set-up and training regime, rebuilt the side with
                shrewd signings from the
                lower divisions and amateur leagues, and led Chelsea to their first major trophy success – the League
                championship – in 1954–55. The
                following season saw UEFA create the European Champions' Cup, but after objections from The Football
                League, Chelsea were persuaded
                to withdraw from the competition before it started.[21][22] Chelsea failed to build on this success, and
                spent the remainder of the
                1950s in mid-table. Drake was dismissed in 1961 and replaced by player-coach Tommy Docherty.
                Docherty built a new team around the group of talented young players emerging from the club's youth
                set-up, and Chelsea challenged
                for honours throughout the 1960s, enduring several near-misses. They were on course for a treble of
                League, FA Cup and League Cup going
                into the final stages of the 1964–65 season, winning the League Cup but faltering late on in the other
                two.[23] In three seasons the side
                were beaten in three major semi-finals and were FA Cup runners-up. Under Docherty's successor, Dave
                Sexton, Chelsea won the FA Cup in 1970,
                beating Leeds United 2–1 in a final replay. The following year, Chelsea took their first European
                honour, a UEFA Cup Winners' Cup triumph,
                with another replayed win, this time over Real Madrid in Athens.

            <h3>Redevelopment and financial crisis</h3>

            <p>
                The late 1970s through to the '80s was a turbulent period for Chelsea. An ambitious redevelopment of
                Stamford Bridge threatened the financial stability of the club,[24] star players were sold and the
                team were relegated. Further problems were caused by a notorious hooligan element among the support,
                which was to plague the club throughout the decade.[25] In 1982, at the nadir of their fortunes, Chelsea
                were acquired by Ken Bates from Mears' great-nephew Brian Mears, for the nominal sum of £1. Bates bought
                a controlling stake in the club and floated Chelsea on the AIM stock exchange in March 1996[26] although
                by now the Stamford Bridge freehold had been sold to property developers, meaning the club faced losing
                their home.[27] On the pitch, the team had fared little better, coming close to relegation to the Third
                Division for the first time, but in 1983 manager John Neal put together an impressive new team for
                minimal
                outlay. Chelsea won the Second Division title in 1983–84 and established themselves in the top division
                with two top-six finishes, before being relegated again in 1988. The club bounced back
                immediately by winning the Second Division championship in 1988–89.
                After a long-running legal battle, Bates reunited the stadium freehold with the club in 1992 by doing a
                deal with the banks
                of the property developers, who had been bankrupted by a market crash.[28] In the mid-1990s Chelsea fan
                and businessman Matthew
                Harding became a director and loaned the club £26 million to build the new North Stand and invest in new
                players.[29] Chelsea's
                form in the new Premier League was unconvincing, although they did reach the 1994 FA Cup final. The
                appointment of Ruud Gullit as
                player-manager in 1996 began an upturn in the team's fortunes. He added several top international
                players to the side and led the club
                to their first major honour since 1971, the FA Cup. Gullit was replaced by Gianluca Vialli, whose reign
                saw Chelsea win the League Cup,
                the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the UEFA Super Cup in 1998, and the FA Cup in 2000. They also mounted a
                strong title challenge in 1998–99,
                finishing four points behind champions Manchester United, and made their first appearance in the UEFA
                Champions League. Vialli was sacked in
                favour of Claudio Ranieri, who guided Chelsea to the 2002 FA Cup final and Champions League
                qualification in 2002–03.

            <h3>2003–2022: Abramovich era</h3>
            <p>
                With the club facing an apparent financial crisis,[31] Bates unexpectedly sold Chelsea F.C. in June 2003
                for £60 million.[32] In so doing,
                he reportedly recognised a personal profit of £17 million on the club he had bought for £1 in 1982 (his
                stake had been diluted to just below 30% over the years).
                The club's new owner was Russian oligarch and billionaire Roman Abramovich, who also took on
                responsibility for the club's £80 million of debt, quickly paying
                some of it. Sergei Pugachev alleged Chelsea was bought on Putin's orders, an allegation Abramovich has
                denied.[33] Bates mentioned that Abramovich was in talks
                to buy Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur before he bought Chelsea in a deal sealed in a day.[34
                Over £100 million was spent on new players, but Ranieri was unable to deliver any trophies,[35] and was
                replaced by José Mourinho.[36]
                Under Mourinho, Chelsea became the fifth English team to win back-to-back league championships since the
                Second World War (2004–05 and 2005–06),[37] in addition to winning
                an FA Cup (2007) and two League Cups (2005 and 2007). After a poor start to the 2007–08 season, Mourinho
                was replaced by Avram Grant,[38] who led the club to their first UEFA Champions
                League final, which they lost on penalties to Manchester United. The club did not turn a profit in the
                first nine years of Abramovich's ownership, and made record losses of £140m in June 2005.[39]
                In 2009, under caretaker manager Guus Hiddink, Chelsea won another FA Cup.[41] In 2009–10, his successor
                Carlo Ancelotti led them to
                their first Premier League and FA Cup Double, also becoming the first English top-flight club to score
                100 league goals in a season since 1963.[42] In 2012, Roberto Di Matteo led Chelsea to their
                seventh FA Cup,[43] and their first UEFA Champions League title, beating Bayern Munich 4–3 on penalties,
                the first London club to win the trophy.[44] The following year the club won the UEFA Europa League,[45]
                making them the first club to hold two major European titles simultaneously and one of five clubs to
                have won the three main UEFA trophies.[46] Mourinho returned as manager in 2013 and led Chelsea to
                League Cup success in March 2015,[47]
                and the Premier League title two months later.[48] Mourinho was sacked after four months of the
                following season after a poor start.[49]
                n November 2012, Chelsea announced a profit of £1.4 million for the year ending 30 June 2012, the first
                time the club had made a profit
                under Abramovich's ownership.[39][50] This was followed by a loss in 2013 and then their highest ever
                profit of £18.4 million for the
                year to June 2014.[51] In 2018 Chelsea announced a record after-tax profit of £62 million.[52]
                In 2017, under new coach Antonio Conte, Chelsea won their sixth English title and the following season
                won their eighth FA Cup.[53] In 2018 Conte was sacked after a fifth-place finish and replaced with
                Maurizio Sarri,[54][55] under whom Chelsea reached the League Cup
                final, which they lost on penalties to Manchester City[56] and won the Europa League for a second time,
                beating Arsenal 4–1 in the final. Sarri then left the club to become manager of Juventus and was
                replaced by former Chelsea player Frank Lampard.[57]
                In Lampard's first season he guided Chelsea to fourth place in the Premier League and reached the FA Cup
                final, losing 2–1 to Arsenal.[58] Lampard was dismissed in January 2021 and replaced with Thomas
                Tuchel.[59][60]
                Under Tuchel, Chelsea reached the FA Cup final, losing 1–0 to Leicester City, and won their second UEFA
                Champions League title with a 1–0 win over Manchester City in Porto.[61] The club subsequently won the
                2021 UEFA Super Cup for the second time by defeating
                Villarreal 6–5 in a penalty shootout, after it had ended 1–1 in Belfast after extra time,[62] and the
                2021 FIFA Club World Cup (the first for the club) in Abu Dhabi after beating Brazilian Palmeiras
                2–1.[63]
                On 18 April 2021, Chelsea announced it would be joining a new European Super League, a league
                competition comprising the biggest European clubs.[64] After a backlash from supporters, the club
                announced their withdrawal days later.[65]
                The club opted against furloughing their non-matchday
                staff during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the decision reportedly coming from Abramovich himself.
                Chelsea, one of the first clubs to help the National Health Service, lent the club-owned Millennium
                Hotel for the NHS staff.[66]
                Amidst financial sanctions leveled at Russian oligarchs by Western governments in response to the 2022
                Russian invasion of Ukraine, Abramovich stated on 26 February that he would hand over the stewardship of
                Chelsea to the trustees of the Chelsea
                Foundation.[68] The trustees did not immediately agree, due to legal concerns regarding the rules of the
                Charity Commission for England and Wales.[69] A week later, Abramovich wrote-off the £1.5 billion the
                club owed him, and put the club up for sale,
                pledging to donate net proceeds from it to the victims of the war in Ukraine.[70][71]
                On 10 March 2022, the British government announced sanctions on Abramovich with Chelsea allowed to
                operate under a special license until 31 May.[72][73] In the following weeks, reports emerged of
                Abramovich's involvement in
                brokering a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia and securing safe evacuation corridors in besieged
                Ukrainian cities.[74][75]
                An American government official revealed that the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy had requested
                that the US government not levy sanctions against Abramovich given his importance to war relief
                efforts.[76]
